# Audio Mixer local bridge (Node.js sandbox)

Zero-dependency Node.js (>=18) helper that runs on your own PC and tells the mixer page which
native audio drivers exist (WASAPI, DirectSound, WDM-KS, MME, installed ASIO drivers on Windows;
CoreAudio on macOS; ALSA / PipeWire / JACK on Linux).

    node bridge/server.js        # then open http://localhost:8765

- Listens on `127.0.0.1` only; read-only; the API accepts only localhost / `file://` origins
  (add more with `BRIDGE_ORIGINS=https://example.com`). Port: `BRIDGE_PORT`.
- The page auto-connects (`universalAsioSdk.connectBridge()`); detected drivers get a `[DETECTED]`
  tag in the DRIVERS tab and "Auto-Detect" uses the bridge's recommendation. Without the bridge
  the page works exactly as before.
- Endpoints: `GET /api/status`, `GET /api/drivers`. Tests: `npm test` in `bridge/`.
